# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and features to enhance functionality, usability, and performance.

## 1. Improved Error Handling
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient errors.
- Add specific error messages for known failure points.

## 2. Enhanced Logging
- Include structured logs for easier debugging and analysis.
- Integrate logging levels to control verbosity.

## 3. Configurable Rate Limiting
- Allow dynamic adjustment of the delay parameter based on user preferences or detected server response times.

## 4. Unit and Integration Testing
- Develop a suite of tests to cover critical code paths and ensure consistent behavior across releases.
- Consider mocking API calls to facilitate testing without network dependencies.

## 5. Performance Optimizations
- Review and optimize any resource-intensive functions or loops.
- Benchmark code to identify and address bottlenecks.

## 6. Documentation and Examples
- Provide example scripts demonstrating typical use cases.
- Create inline documentation with specific usage examples.
